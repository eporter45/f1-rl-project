# üèéÔ∏è F1 Reinforcement Learning Project

A deep reinforcement learning framework for simulating and optimizing Formula 1 driving strategies.  
This project explores control, racing dynamics, and decision-making using RL agents trained to handle high-speed racing environments.

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to model an autonomous Formula 1 driver capable of learning optimal racing policies through simulation.  
Agents are trained to handle throttle, brake, and steering control while optimizing for speed, cornering efficiency, and stability.

## üß† Core Objectives
- Develop a reinforcement learning environment simulating F1 dynamics  
- Train agents using algorithms like PPO, DDPG, or SAC  
- Optimize lap times and control smoothness through reward shaping  
- Visualize racing lines, telemetry data, and policy convergence  
- Compare learned strategies to classical control baselines
