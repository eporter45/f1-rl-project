# üèéÔ∏è F1 Reinforcement Learning Project (in progress)

A deep reinforcement learning framework for simulating and optimizing Formula 1 driving strategies.  
This project explores control, racing dynamics, and decision-making using RL agents trained to handle high-speed racing environments.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project models Formula 1 racing as a **multi-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, where each car acts as an autonomous agent interacting within a shared, competitive environment.  

Each agent (driver) must learn an optimal policy for **continuous control** ‚Äî managing throttle, braking, steering, and gear shifting ‚Äî while responding dynamically to other agents, track geometry, and physics-based constraints.  

The environment simulates a continuous-time racing system with stochastic elements such as traction limits, tire degradation, and aerodynamic drag, allowing for rich strategic and control behaviors to emerge.  

The research goal is to explore how **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** can lead to adaptive, human-like race strategies that balance:
- **Speed:** maximizing lap performance under dynamic conditions  
- **Safety:** maintaining stability and avoiding collisions  
- **Strategy:** choosing overtaking, cornering, and energy management behaviors optimally

### üß© Conceptual Model

Each race is formalized as an MDP defined by:
- **State space (S):** position, velocity, heading, tire temps, opponent proximities, track curvature, etc.  
- **Action space (A):** throttle %, brake force, steering angle, gear shift  
- **Transition function (T):** vehicle dynamics governed by simplified physics models  
- **Reward function (R):** weighted combination of progress along track, smoothness, and penalty for collisions/off-track events  

In the multi-agent setting, the system extends to a **Markov Game**, where:
- Each agent‚Äôs reward depends on both its own state/action and those of its competitors  
- Agents learn policies œÄ·µ¢(a|s) using deep RL algorithms (e.g., MADDPG, MAPPO)  
- The environment enforces **shared resources** (track space, slipstream effects, collisions) and **competitive rewards** (finishing position, lap time)

### üß© Research Directions
- Investigating **emergent race strategies** under different reward formulations  
- Studying **cooperative vs. competitive dynamics** in multi-agent driving  
- Comparing **centralized vs. decentralized training** approaches  
- Exploring **domain transfer** to real-world telemetry or sim racing data (e.g., F1 23 or F1 Telemetry APIs)

### üèÅ Vision
Ultimately, this project aims to create a controllable, extensible platform for studying **reinforcement learning in continuous, adversarial control environments** ‚Äî using F1 racing as a testbed for algorithmic creativity, control theory, and autonomous behavior modeling.
