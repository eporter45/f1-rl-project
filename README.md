# f1-rl-project
Reinforcement Learning F1 Project
This Project aimed at Modeling F1 Race Strategy as Markov Decision Processes. 
Through Scraping past race data, a database for the learing the optimal policy was made.
Then we used this dataset to find the optimal decision for a given lap of a grand prix.
